# Skill Assessment:
- According to the challenge description, we are given a webshell on the foothold server. We will use this foothold server to pivot and enumerate other hosts. Proceed to answer the questions after gathering information from the foothold server.<br>

- While reading a file in the home directory of the webadmin user, we discovered login credentials for another server. <br>

- I will use Metasploit to perform pivoting (refer back to the lesson content for detailed steps). After configuring the proxy, I will scan for online hosts within the 172.16.5.0/16 IP range. I discovered two IPs â€” one belonging to the foothold server and another belonging to a different machine.<br>

- I performed an Nmap scan on the .35 server and found several open ports, including RDP, SMB, and others.<br>

- Using the credentials found in the file, I successfully logged in to the discovered server via RDP.<br>

- At this point, I proceeded to enumerate the server and found the first flag file. I then read its contents and submitted the answer.<br>

- The task requires identifying a vulnerable user, and the hint suggests dumping credentials from the LSASS process. I transferred Mimikatz to the target server and used it to dump the LSASS process. From the output, I was able to extract additional credentials belonging to the user vfrank.<br>

- I proceeded to use the runas command to launch a command prompt as the user vfrank.<br>

- Next, we need to enumerate which hosts are active within the 172.16.6.0 range. During this step, we discovered that two hosts are online: 172.16.6.25 and 172.16.6.45.<br>

- From the CMD session running as vfrank, we will proceed to RDP into the servers at 172.16.6.25 and 172.16.6.45 to retrieve the flag files.<br>

- There is a shared drive on this machine. Accessing it, we are able to obtain the final flag.<br>
